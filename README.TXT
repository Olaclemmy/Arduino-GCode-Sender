Arduino-GRBL-Controller 

This is my GRBL controller.

I made this because I wanted to be able to use my X-Carve machine with a stand alone controller and be able to submit GCode files from an SD Card.

The arduino sketch works but I am not completely happy with the move function. So that may improve in the future.

HARDWARE:
 1) Arduino Uno 
 2) 4x20 lcd screen with i2c interface 
 3) small analog joystick 
 4) sd card reader 
 5) a few extra buttons will be added later.

Use at your own risk.
